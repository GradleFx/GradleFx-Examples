This multi-project example uses no conventions. This is probably the worst case project you can have, so this is not recommended. 
But it shows how you can override every convention.

It consists of 3 projects:
  * client: compiles to a SWF. Depends on the domain and util project
  * domain: compiles to a SWC. Depends on the util project
  * util: compiles to a SWC.
